PSEUDOCODE 

Select preferred region and gender (M, F, doesn't matter) from dropdown
    - dropdown will have some examples of countries (i.e. great britain, finland, etc.), which we will need to translate to the country code from the API (ex. label="Canada" value = "CA" in HTML)

User submits their country/gender, and we make an API call based on their selection 

API returns 15 identities, and we store it 

We are going to run a .forEach() loop through the stored API data and pull out name/DOB/index number of each result

Display (append the result list) that list to the user 

The user will select their preferred identity

Based on their selection, we will display the full identity profile to the user
We will reference the selected index number, but this time we will be pulling more information to make the full identity profile 
    - First/Last Name, gender, location, email address, username, password, DOB, phone numbers, photo
